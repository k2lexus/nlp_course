Assignment
Theory questions:
a. What is the purpose of the function bptt_batch() and repackage_hidden() in model.py

b. Describe an overview procedure of the function train() in model.py

Don't train the model. In this assignment, we focus on writing an inference of a neural network using available pre-trained model. Let's write an inference file predict.py containing three functions:
a. load_model(): Load saved argument file and model file
b. rev_gen(): Generate a review starting from SOS until reaching EOS
c. wd_pred(): Predict a word given some previous words


/--------------------------- C O D E

wlst: word list of words with number of appearance exceed 'cutoff'
wlst = [PAD, UNK, SOS, EOS] + wlst -> Cong them 4 gia tri dac biet
self.w2i = wvocab -> tu dien cac tu xay dung tu training data, word: occur
self.i2w = ivocab -> occur: word
vocab.minibatches: generate mini batches data to train/ test
pad_sequences: pad sequences with PAD to be same length
idx2tensor: chuyen thanh torch tensor
init_hidden: init 0 weighs cho cac hidden layer, theo batch size
bptt_batch: generate smaller data(sentences) by cut them follow 'bptt' arg, with source = target(autoencoder)
